These files pull the team list from The Blue Alliance API, and pulls the EPA values from the Statbotics API

**all EPA values are the team's average over all of their events, not the event being displayed**
*this tool is a way to compare teams relative to their overall EPA values, and comparing teams can be useful for coming up with picks*
Use scoutingTEAMv2.py and graphTEAMv2.py to compare and view EPA values for specific teams
Use scoutingEVENTv2.py and graphEVENTv2.py to look at a team's overall EPA compared to other teams at a specific event
